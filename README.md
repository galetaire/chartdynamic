## Description

This site is a proof of concept for dynamic charts created with https://www.chartjs.org/. The data has been hard-coded, meaning that is integrated in it's respective ``.js`` file, along with the functional code.

Therefor, there is no unique database from which the data is called. However, it is possible to use a ``.csv`` file. A good example for future reference is the following by [Peter Cook](https://twitter.com/peter_r_cook):
